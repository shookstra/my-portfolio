        Hi, my name is Sam. Welcome to my site! I graduated in 2019 from
        Southeast Community College in Lincoln with my Associate's of Applied
        Science in Computer Information Technology with a focus in PC and Web
        Development. I am constantly using my skills in creative ways to problem
        solve, troubleshoot, design and develop in a variety of languages and
        applications. I'm always down to learn new languages and techniques for
        different work and personal projects. When I'm not in front of the
        keyboard, you can find me whipping up a new recipe in the kitchen,
        spinning some vinyl, or pouring a hot cup of joe. Check out my
        portfolio, and connect with me at
        <a href="mailto:samhookstra@protonmail.com"
          >samhookstra@protonmail.com</a
        >
        or on
